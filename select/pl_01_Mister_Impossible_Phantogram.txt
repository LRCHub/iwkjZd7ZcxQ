If I told you,
you'd think I was crazy, yeah
I'm the sun and the moon
and the stars
I'm the earth,
I'm the water you walk on, yeah
I'm the sun and the moon
and the stars
Dead guy, I wanna see the light
What's on the other side?
Will that satisfy me?
Right now
I see a million miles
Feel like a holy child
I'll let the night keep rolling
Isn't it exciting?
(What am I gonna do?)
Feels oh so inviting
(Just what you wanted to)
Is this what you wanted?
(Mr. Impossible)
No time for deciding
(Mr. Impossible)
(Mr. Impossible)
(Mr. Impossible)
Red sky
And now I see your eyes
It's gonna be alright
It's so electrifying
Right now,
my mind is opened wide
My heart is satisfied
The light is overflowing
Isn't it exciting?
(What am I gonna do?)
Feels oh so inviting
(Just what you wanted to)
Is this what you wanted?
(Mr. Impossible)
No time for deciding
(Mr. Impossible)
(Mr. Impossible)
(Mr. Impossible)
If i told you,
you'd think I was crazy, yeah
I'm the sun and the moon
and the stars
I'm the earth,
I'm the water you walk on, yeah
I'm the sun and the moon
and the stars
Mr. Impossible
